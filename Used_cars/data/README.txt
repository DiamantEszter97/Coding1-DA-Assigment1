The aim of this analysis to determine linear regression among price of used cars and their odometer reading and age. The main research question is how these descriptive variables affect the price of the vehicles while the main focus will be the causality behind the association of the variables. The first assumption is that the higher the odometer reading and older the car is, the worth of the vehicle will decrease. The selected dataset is originated from craiglist, a well-know website for selling and buying for everyone, focusing on the United state market.
